worst experience with Sterling Hospital vadodara!

My father went for body check-up to sterling hospital at he got appointment for 8.30 a.m.
they reached at 8.30, and they came at reception, no one there at reception,
my father was trying to looking someone, who guide properly for body checkup, but no staff available and not taking any responsible for guid such small kind of information.
then finally he tried to call on same landline number, From which he got the appointment, but no response from the call also, now it's 9.15 a.m, still no one are there, 
after waiting more 15 min, 

finally came on receptionist staff, my father was trying to discussed with her regarding appointment and all, she simply said, just fill the form and pay the amount,
my father said, i'll pay all amount, but where are other staff, who taking blood sample, cardio etc..
after some discussion, my father left hospital without check-up at around 9.35 a.m.
my father literally frustrated.

very worst service/staff as we faced in sterling.
